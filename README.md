# Indiware-Vertretungsplan

These are 2 simple Scripts for a Discord bot that can send the next Day planer for youre class
the "plan.py" give you data about the next day on the planer
you need to put in youre school number on the first link where schoolnumber is said
then you also need to put in user and password on the same link where it is said

the "main.py" starts a Discord Bot, you need to fill in some data in the "loop" function to get working
just simply put in youre Discord Bot tokken in the Discord_client.run() and it will work if you modified the plan.py
